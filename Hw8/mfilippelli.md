CLARITY : Trip duration could be rendered  in minutes for better clarity or take log scales for seconds if pattern is all we are after , A larger fig size could be incorporated 

ESTHETIC : Graph is color blind compliant which is good . The graph is neat and properly named. though title is missing , also grid() could make it more readable.


HONESTY: : The pattern is clear, more with the quadratic curve. If two fit are considered then an LR test could be used to validate which one is better. but over all good graph .
