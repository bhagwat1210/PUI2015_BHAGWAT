CLARITY :The plot is understandable. But I did not understand the Color bar on the right and how is that related is not clear .

ESTETIC : The trend is visible and nicley plotted. The names of axis and title are clear . The units are also mentioned . The color used is not color blind compliant. 

HONEST : The plot is honest and reproducible.
