reviews were ok. on the short side but ok. 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT 
===================

the plot says color blind compliant, but really the color blind compliance is only important when multiple colors are present. 

spaces are missing between words and parenthesis in both label and title

the 3D is acrually justified but the position of the points in the 3d space is hard to read. i think the transparency is attempting to make it more clear but it does not increase readability and the lack of legend makes it confusing to understand its meaning

axis ticks are too small








NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


MFilippelli
============


the station id is a categorical value, not a continuous one, so it should not be plotted as a position (and the idea of doing a regression on it is odd and really meaningless)

the regression lines are very thick, which does not add to readability. 

in color-blind simulations the colors become undistinguishable, particularly the green



============


the time series are of very different order of magnitude. thus all of them are unvisible and cluster at the bottom . log y should be used.

why is the plot resolution so low?

there are too many time series on the plot. even with log space the result would likely be confusing. 

for the y ticks a compressed notation for the large numbers should be chosen to enhance readability

good legend and good size for the labels.

consider steps instead of lines joining points for time series

============
  
the choice of background color for the plot is odd: it reduces the contrast and the readability of the plot. 

there are too many datapoints compromizing readability. consider a contour plot. 
the color is not explained. 

the legend on white background is distracting from the rest of the plot given the choice for background color
